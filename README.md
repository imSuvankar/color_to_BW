# Photo-Processor

Image converter that processes colour images and turns them black and white (24bit to 8bit).

Download the .py file and place it inside a folder. Inside the same folder, create a folder "samples" for sample images and "converted" for B/W images. Populate "samples" with images that need converting. Install the PIL (pillow) and tqdm libraries, either manually or by using pip.

Run the downloaded .py file in an IDE of your choice. The code will ask for a starting and ending index correlating to the number of photos that have to be converted. Once the task is finished, a completion message will be shown. Hit ENTER to terminate the program.
