# color_to_BW
This code can convert one or multiple color images into black and white images (24bit to 8bit). 


Prerequisites :
    1. Download the .py file and place it in a separate folder.
    2. In that folder create 2 more folders: "samples" and "converted".
    3. Keep multiple color photos in "samples" which you want to convert.
    4. Install "pillow" (PIL) and "tqdm" if not installed already [install using pip or download manually].


When all these conditions are satisfied, open an IDE and run the python file.
It will first take some time to count the file number in the "samples" directory.
Then will as you for a starting and ending index (range).
Finally it will start converting those selected files and show you a progress bar.
When all the files will get converted successfully, it will show a confirmation message.
Atlast by hitting "ENTER" you can terminate the program.
